## Component Structure

│ ├── MyComponent.js
│ ├── MyComponent.module.scss
│ ├── MyComponent.test.js
```

### Optional

If you want to split your component in pieces for readability, maintainability, or any other reason you could put the secondary components in the same folder. This is only for cases where these secondary components are only used inside MyComponent. If later they want to be used in other places they should be extracted to their own folder inside components.

```
├── MyComponent
│ ├── index.js
│ ├── MyComponent.js
│ ├── MyComponent.module.scss
│ ├── MyComponent.test.js
│ ├── SecondaryComponent.js
│ ├── SecondaryComponent.module.scss
```

## Features

1. Based on [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/)
2. Powerful but simple routing system based on protected and public routes.
3. The httpClient provides status code errors handling, and camelCase to snake_case automatic conversion.
4. Async actions and store hydration.
5. [Absolut imports](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/importing-a-component/#absolute-imports).
6. Environment-specific routes and settings provided through the built-in [environment variables](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-custom-environment-variables) system provided by CRA.

## Prerequisites

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) 10.16.3 or greater.
2. Install [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) as package manager.

## List of Packages

### State management

- [redux](https://redux.js.org): the state management solution.
- [react-redux](https://react-redux.js.org): provides an easy way to connect the React components to the store.
- [redux-persist](https://github.com/rt2zz/redux-persist): persists the user session data in the localStorage.
- [redux-promise-middleware](https://docs.psb.design/redux-promise-middleware/): handle async actions and side effects.
- [redux-thunk](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk): as a power-up for the 'redux-promise-middleware'.
- [redux-devtools-extension](http://extension.remotedev.io/): useful tool for debugging.

### API Requests:

- [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios): HTTP client.
- [humps](https://github.com/domchristie/humps): converts camelCase to snake_case and vice versa.

### Routing:

- [react-router-dom](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/quick-start): the most popular and powerful routing solution for React.

### Type checking:

- [prop-types](https://github.com/facebook/prop-types): Runtime type checking for React props and similar objects.

### Datetime:

- [dayjs](https://github.com/iamkun/dayjs): A minimalist JavaScript library that parses, validates, manipulates, and displays dates and times for modern browsers with a largely Moment.js-compatible API. This tool isn't installed in our project, but we recommend to use it, you can install it running `yarn add dayjs`.

### Testing:

- [jest](https://jestjs.io/): a delightful JavaScript Testing Framework with a focus on simplicity.
- [react-testing-library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro): a very light-weight solution for testing React components.
- [nock](https://github.com/nock/nock): HTTP server mocking and expectations library for Node.js
- [cypress](https://www.cypress.io/): automated integration tests. This tool isn't installed in our project, but we recommend to use it. You can install it running `yarn add cypress --dev`. For more information about the configuration you can read [this guide](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/installing-cypress.html#System-requirements)

### Styling:

- [sass](https://sass-lang.com/guide): "CSS with superpowers", superpowers which allow us for a cleaner syntax when extending or importing variables while using CSS modules.
- [css-modules](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-a-css-modules-stylesheet): CSS-Modules helps us to have a more component-based styling avoiding possible conflicts and pollutants of the style across the app.
- [tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/utility-first): Improves development speed by simplifying the syntax and giving us a single place to set CSS property-related values.

### Deployment:

- [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/): "The fastest way to build the fastest sites". We recommend Netlify as a hosting solution. The free plan is very generous and meets the basic needs of any standard project. In addition, it is dead simple to set up and use. For more information, you can dig into the [official docs](https://docs.netlify.com/).
